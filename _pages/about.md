Hi! Iâ€™m Yadi Liu, a junior undergraduate student at [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).  
My research interests span the broad field of human-computer interaction. I aim to utilize technology to enhance human capabilities.  
Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:  
- Designing AI systems or technologies to better serve human being
- AI for education, improving learning experiences
- Exploring the practical applications of LLM technologies, investigating and improving their potential across various domains, and examining how LLMs can be used to enhance system intelligence and human-centric interaction

 ## Research Experience
 ### Problem-Solving Analysis via Graph-Based Thought Process Modeling
Advised by Prof. [Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/), Tsinghua University  
2024.06 - Present  
- Designed a novel graph-based model to represent and analyze thought processes, proposed a semi-automated generation method based on Large Language Model(LLM) and expert-assisted correction.
- Conducted user experiments using the thought processes of high school students' solving homework problems as an example, developed a system that can display the thought processes and characteristics to teachers and students.
- Proposed algorithms for analyzing individual and group thinking characteristics, providing both students and teachers with valuable assistance for self-improvement.

 ### Explainable and Accurate Multimodal Reasoning for College-Level Circuit Analysis Problems
Advised by Prof. [Hongning Wang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/), Tsinghua University  
2023.11-2024.06  
- Constructed Question-Answer(QA) dataset and discipline database Knowledge-Base(KB) using ChatGPT4v and Claude3, built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) system to retrieve discipline-specific knowledge and aid in language model generation.
- Designed prompts, made Large Language Model(LLM) conduct interactive multi-round questioning for specific discipline, guiding students to think step by step by rhetorical questions without telling the answer directly in the process of answering students' questions.

 ### Revealing User's Attention Scale through Eye-Tracking Techniques: A Geometric Modeling and Verification Study
Advised by Prof. [Yuntao Wang](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/YuntaoWang/), Tsinghua University  
2023.11-2024.01  
- Proposed two factors relative to attention scale, Pupil Diameter and Intersection Distance, that can be measured through current eye-tracking techniques and explained both factors with geometric models.
- Developed an interface in Python, connected it to an eye-tracking device and collected participants' experimental data.
- Conducted an experiment involving 13 participants, collected data through self-developed website and Tobbi Eye-tracker and analyzed results using matplotlib and numpy.

 ## Projects
  1. **Instant Messaging System**
      - Designed and developed an instant messaging system similar to WeChat using WebSocket, ensuring real-time communication.
  2. **Raytracing Renderer**
      - Implemented a simple raytracing renderer in C++, supporting many of the major ray tracing algorithms and a variety of shading units, models, textures and other features.
  3. **MiniGLM**
      - Completed the pre-training and fine-tuning of a language model using Jin Yong's novels as training data, to answer relevant questions about the stories.
  4. **Minidecaf Compiler**
      - Developed a compiler to compile MiniDecaf Code to RISC-V Assembly Code, Including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, data flow analysis, register allocation, target platform assembly code generation and other steps.
  5. **Crawler and Information System**
      - Used a web crawler to crawl Sina News, and implemented a website system using Django to display the crawled news, including a search function.
  6. **Pinyin Input Method**
      - Completed Pinyin Input Method using Vertebi algorithm based on Binary and Ternary Models of Characters, achieved up 56% sentence accuracy and up 85% word accuracy.
  7. **Text Sentiment Classification**
      - Completed Text Sentiment Classification with Mainstream Models like MLP, TextCNN, LSTM.
  8. **Multi-Agent Dou DiZhu AI**
      - Combined pre-trained models to train PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), significantly advancing AI performance toward human expert levels in Dou Dizhu.
  9. **Social Link**
      - Designed an intelligent social assistance assistant to help users better socialize with others in social situations where the purpose is weak and the social counterparts are mostly strangers.
  10. **CLitBot**
      - Implemented a simplified robot light-switching game for the command-line interface.
