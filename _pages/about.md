Hi! Iâ€™m Yadi Liu, a junior undergraduate student at [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).  
My research interests span the broad field of human-computer interaction. I aim to utilize technology to enhance human capabilities.  
Specifically, I am interested in the following topics:  
- Designing AI systems or technologies to better serve human being
- AI for education, improving learning experiences
- Exploring the practical applications of LLM technologies, investigating and improving their potential across various domains, and examining how LLMs can be used to enhance system intelligence and human-centric interaction
